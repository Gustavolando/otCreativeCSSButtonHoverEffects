## Creative CSS Button Hover Effects

This is a tiny but also looking nice CSS button animation from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxfo8tvHqk) I made a few months ago and want to share it here.

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I love the glowing effects on animation, so I got very excited when coded this amazing practice.

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCreativeCSSButtonHoverEffects/) !
